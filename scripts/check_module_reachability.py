"""Fail when a `pub mod` in src/lib.rs has no non-test call site in src/.

AGENTS.md makes ledger reconciliation a pre-commit invariant to stop "completion
illusion where all beads appear closed but critical gaps remain untracked". On
2026-08-24 that illusion happened anyway (bd-33df9): five modules landed with
green unit tests, their beads were closed, and nothing in the product ever
called them. `scripts/reconcile_beads_ledger.sh` exited 0 throughout, because it
only cross-references the parity gap ledger and structurally cannot see a bead
closed against code that compiles, tests clean, and is unreachable.

This gate closes that class. A module that only its own tests reference is not a
shipped feature, and saying so out loud is cheap.

Library-only modules are legitimate -- the SDK deliberately exposes surface no
internal caller uses -- so they are declared in ALLOWLIST with a reason instead
of being silently tolerated. The reason string is the point: it converts "nobody
noticed" into "someone decided".

Exit 0 = every module is reachable or explicitly allowlisted.
Exit 1 = at least one module is unreachable and undeclared.
