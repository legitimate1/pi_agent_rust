//! E2E: extension observation-event parity across every agent-driving surface
//! (bd-82331).
//!
//! ## What this proves that the inventory test cannot
//!
//! `tests/extension_event_routing.rs` reads the source and checks that every
//! surface still makes the routing call. That catches a surface being added or
//! rewritten without it, and it caught nothing when `/new` and `/resume` built
//! replacement sessions with no runtime to dispatch onto — because the routing
//! call was right where the table said it should be, in a file that correctly
//! declares `routes: false`, and the session handed to it simply could not use
//! it. Only running a real extension through a real turn finds that class.
//!
//! So: one fixture extension, one scripted turn with a streaming assistant
//! message and a tool call, driven through every surface, and the event streams
//! compared.
//!
//! ## How the events are observed
//!
//! Through pi's own log, not through the extension. An extension cannot report
//! what it received in a way that works on all five surfaces: its `node:fs` is
//! a sandboxed VFS whose writes need not reach the host disk, and its stdout is
//! swallowed by both TUIs. `ExtensionManager::dispatch_event_value` and
//! `dispatch_event_batch` both emit `ext.event.start` at info, which is the
//! host's own record of what it handed to extensions — after the hook check, so
//! a logged line means an extension really was called. `TuiAwareLogWriter`
//! sends that to stderr normally and to `<global_dir>/logs/tui.log` while a TUI
//! owns the terminal, which is exactly the two collection points below.
//!
//! ## What is compared, and what deliberately is not
//!
//! Observation events reach extensions by two internal routes with independent
//! timing: coalescable kinds (`message_update`, `tool_execution_update`) go
//! through the in-flight/pending path, everything else through a batch drain.
//! Their interleaving is therefore not deterministic and asserting on it would
//! buy a flaky test in exchange for nothing. What is deterministic, and what
//! this asserts:
//!
//! - the ORDERED sequence of non-coalescable observation events, which share
//!   one buffer and preserve arrival order;
//! - the SET of observation kinds delivered, which is the actual subject of
//!   bd-82331 — a surface that routes nothing has an empty set;
//! - that the four lifecycle events arrive on every surface, since they take
//!   the in-loop route and must not depend on the surface at all.
//!
//! Coalesced event COUNTS are recorded in the artifact but not asserted equal:
//! dropping duplicates is what the coalescer is for, and how many survive
//! depends on scheduling.
