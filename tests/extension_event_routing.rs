//! Every surface that drives the agent must route observation events to
//! extensions, and this test exists so the next one cannot quietly forget
//! (bd-82331).
//!
//! ## Why a source-inventory test rather than a behavioural one
//!
//! `AgentEvent`s reach extensions by two routes. The four lifecycle events
//! (`agent_start`, `agent_end`, `turn_start`, `turn_end`) are dispatched from
//! inside the agent loop, so every surface gets them for free. The six
//! observation events — `message_start`, `message_update`, `message_end`,
//! `tool_execution_start`, `tool_execution_update`, `tool_execution_end` —
//! reach extensions only if the surface routes its own event stream through
//! `EventCoalescer::dispatch_agent_event_lazy`.
//!
//! That is a per-surface obligation with no compiler support, and two of five
//! surfaces did not meet it: the SDK path, and therefore the default
//! `FrankenTUI` interactive stack, delivered lifecycle events and nothing else.
//! There was no error and no warning, because the events were never routed
//! rather than dropped in transit. An extension that observes looked installed
//! and did nothing, on the stack most users run.
//!
//! A behavioural parity test across five surfaces would be the stronger check
//! and is worth building, but it needs a real binary under tmux for two of
//! them. This inventory test is deterministic, runs in milliseconds, and
//! catches the specific failure that actually happened: a surface added or
//! rewritten without the routing call. The `reason` field is the point — it
//! converts "nobody noticed" into "someone decided", the same way the
//! module-reachability allowlist does.
