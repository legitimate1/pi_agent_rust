# Review and approve workspace refactors

Symbol renames, file moves, and edit-only code actions can be inspected before
any target files change.
A preview retains one immutable, already-staged transaction. Approval commits
those staged final images; it does not ask the language server for another
rename, re-resolve a code action, or recalculate edits against newer contents.

## Extract, inline, and fix imports with review

List code actions for an exact UTF-16 range and a kind such as
`refactor.extract`, `refactor.inline`, or `source.organizeImports`:

```json
{"action":"code_actions","file":"src/lib.rs","range":{"start":{"line":8,"character":4},"end":{"line":10,"character":12}},"only":["refactor.extract"]}
```

Select the returned `actionId` without `apply:true` to resolve and stage its
complete workspace edit. This consumes the selected action handle and returns
a `refactorId`; no target files change:

```json
{"action":"code_actions","actionId":"<listed action ID>"}
```

Inspect or approve that exact plan using **only** the new handle:

```json
{"action":"code_actions","refactorId":"<preview ID>"}
```

```json
{"action":"code_actions","refactorId":"<preview ID>","apply":true}
```

A fresh `query` also selects one action for preview when `apply` is omitted or
false. Queries match a unique title or a one-based index **after** the `only`
filter. Without `query` or `actionId`, a non-applying request is still a list.
Explicit `apply:true` with `actionId` or a fresh query preserves direct
application. A blank query is an error, not an implicit selection.

The source's synchronized incarnation is retained from the original listing,
including servers without wire document versions. Closing and reopening the
same bytes cannot revive an old action before resolution. At preview staging,
the transaction also captures unopened affected files. Approval never sends
another `textDocument/codeAction` or `codeAction/resolve` request.

**Command-backed actions are not complete static plans.** Preview rejects
both command-only and edit-plus-command actions with
`LSP_ACTION_NOT_PREVIEWABLE`, including commands added during lazy resolution.
It does not execute the command to discover effects or silently approve just
its inline edits. List again and explicitly use `apply:true` on the selected
action to use the existing command workflow. Such direct execution is not
covered by a reviewed `refactorId` and can have additional command effects.

### Quick fixes from pull-only diagnostics

When `diagnosticProvider` is advertised, a fresh code-action listing or query
first obtains `textDocument/diagnostic` for the synchronized source. It passes
the accepted diagnostics, including opaque diagnostic `data`, into the action
request's context. This makes quick fixes available without a separate manual
diagnostics call, even when the server never publishes push notifications.
An explicit empty report is accepted immediately; failed, malformed, or stale
reports stop the workflow rather than becoming an empty diagnostic context.
The existing pull-result cache can reuse unchanged reports for the same source
revision and requests a new full report after resynchronization.
Starting a fresh listing retires previous action handles, including when the
new diagnostic request fails; an old quick fix cannot survive a failed refresh.

Listings expose `diagnosticsSource` (`pull` or `cache`) and `diagnosticCount`.
Push-only servers retain their cached-context behavior; an empty cache does not
prove that a report was received. Pulling does not grant server-edit permission.
Each protocol request retains the existing per-request timeout/cancellation
discipline. Inspection or approval by `refactorId` does not pull diagnostics,
recompute the code action, or resolve it a second time.

## Symbol rename

Request the rename with `apply:false`:

```json
{"action":"rename","file":"src/lib.rs","symbol":"old_name","newName":"new_name","apply":false}
```

The result includes `applied:false`, `preview:true`, a `refactorId`, the
complete `workspaceEdit`, and a sorted `files` array. Each file entry has
`beforeBytes`, `afterBytes`, and `changed`. A null byte count means the path is
absent at that stage. Unchanged entries include source guards and no-op targets
that also constrain later approval. Positions in the edit are zero-based
UTF-16; the existing symbol selector's optional `line` remains one-based.

Inspect the same plan again without making another server request:

```json
{"action":"rename","refactorId":"<returned ID>"}
```

Approve it explicitly:

```json
{"action":"rename","refactorId":"<returned ID>","apply":true}
```

A selected `refactorId` accepts only its original `action`, `apply`, and
`timeout`. It cannot be combined with file paths, names, positions, ranges,
queries, or other selectors. The preview is the plan being approved, not a
starting point that the approval request can override.

**Fresh requests preserve their existing behavior:** omitting `apply`, or
setting it to true, still applies a fresh symbol or file rename immediately.
Use false to request review. By contrast, a selected `refactorId` writes only
when `apply:true` is explicitly supplied; omitted or false means inspect.

## File moves and imports

```json
{"action":"rename_file","file":"src/old.rs","newFile":"src/nested/new.rs","apply":false}
```

When the server advertises a matching file-operation registration, Pi requests
`workspace/willRenameFiles`. The returned import updates and the final move
are staged together. Preview does not create destination directories, write
scratch files, change imports, move the source, or send `didRenameFiles`.

```json
{"action":"rename_file","refactorId":"<returned ID>","apply":true}
```

Approval applies the combined transaction once. A registered
`workspace/didRenameFiles` notification is written only after successful
application, and `notificationWritten` reports whether that write succeeded.
It is not an acknowledgment that the server has finished indexing the move.
If notification delivery fails after commit, the result still reports
`applied:true`, contains a warning, and retires the connection. **Do not repeat
the move**; reload the language server instead. A rejected approval or failed
transaction does not send this notification.

Servers without a matching registration can still preview and approve the
requested move, but do not supply import updates or receive notifications.
The result exposes `willRenameFiles` and `notificationRequested` so that
absence of integration is not mistaken for updated imports.

## Identity, freshness, and authority

One plan is retained per `LspTool` instance. IDs are opaque and cannot be used
on another instance. A fresh rename or an admitted code-action listing or
selection replaces the previous plan. Reload,
refactor application, server death, and expiry invalidate old plans. Plans are
usable for five minutes after creation; inspection does not extend that time.
Expiry is checked on use, not by a background eviction task.

Approval checks the original bytes, permissions, existence, and canonical
routes of every staged file, including previously unopened sibling files and
absent destinations. Recreated destinations and changed guard-only sources
cannot silently become new baselines. It also retains the synchronized
incarnations of participating open documents and the exact live server
connection; closing and reopening identical text still invalidates a plan.

Existing request-time source and known-document version/hash checks remain
in force before staging. **Previously unopened files acquire their exact
preimages when the preview is staged after the server responds, not at request
start.** A preview is not a snapshot of every dependency or proof that the
server's analysis is globally up to date.

Each inspection or approval requires the current caller's filesystem I/O
authority and cancellation checks. An earlier request's authority does not
grant a later caller permission. Invalid overriding selectors, foreign IDs,
and a mismatched action do not consume the matching valid plan.
Once a matching, admitted selection begins validation, failures retire it;
applications consume it before any write. Reusing an applied or retired ID
returns `LSP_REFACTOR_STALE` without another server request. Correct the
conflict and obtain a new preview rather than retrying the old ID.

Neither preview nor approval opens a server-command edit permission window.
Unsolicited `workspace/applyEdit` requests remain rejected. Approval applies
only the reviewed local transaction, not arbitrary command side effects.

## Bounds and failure semantics

The complete preview, including the full workspace edit and file metadata,
must fit within 200 KiB of serialized JSON. Larger previews fail with
`LSP_EDIT_LIMIT` and do not issue an approval handle; there is no approval of
silently omitted edits. The existing transaction limits still apply: 16 MiB
per file, 64 MiB of snapshot/replacement accounting, and 1,024 loaded paths.
Only one staged plan is retained, and replacement or consumption releases it.

The transaction uses the existing regular-file validation, permission
preservation, preimage rechecks, and rollback-on-reported-error mechanism.
Directories as edit targets, symlinks, shared hard links, special files, and
file/directory shape changes remain unsupported. Incomplete rollback remains
an explicit `LSP_EDIT_ROLLBACK` error with recovery information, and the plan
is consumed even on that failure.

`atomic:false` is deliberate: this is not cross-file atomic visibility,
power-loss recovery, or an OS sandbox against hostile concurrent directory
replacement. Synchronous filesystem I/O cannot be preempted by the approval
timeout or cancellation checks. Once commit begins it follows the existing
finish-or-rollback discipline rather than abandoning a partially changed
workspace.
